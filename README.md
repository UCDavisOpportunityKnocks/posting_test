## Posting Experiment

I was messing around with code to create an admin panel. The purpose of the admin panel is to be the only user to post discounts and promos. Those post will then be displayed on the homescreen for every user.

This uses Firebase.

Not null safe.

This kinda works, it's really jank, but it works for now.
